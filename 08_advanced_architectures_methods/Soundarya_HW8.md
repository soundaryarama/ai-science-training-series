Homework 8

I'm Soundarya and my research focuses on a flow visualization technique using critical points in the flow over bio-inspired undulated cylinders. Seal whiskers possess a unique geometry when compred to other mammal whiskers, consisting of a dual set of undulations along their span and this has been studied for their significant reduction in drag and vortex-induced vibration (VIV) when compared to smooth elliptical cylinders. These reduced forces and vibrations are intricately linked with the three-dimensional vortex formations downstream. My work attempts to understand these vortex structures using critical points. Critical points describe the flow topology around their neighborhood and are classified to a first-order approximation based on linear properties of the vector field. In order to classify critical points in different regions based on the vortex structures, we are doing a coorelation algorithm and for classifying regions based on images, we are implementing an autoencoder neural network model to understand and eliminate the noise in the images we generated from our CFD simulation. The data from our CFD simulation is huge, upto 4M datapoints in the mesh. My aim in this work is make good use of the computer resources available and AI to make meaningful interpretations of our data.
